# solar-wind-energy-volatility-
This project explores whether geomagenetic disturbances from solar activity correlate with spikes in UK electricity prices. It applies time series analysis and correlation techniques using Python, and is part of an independant research initiative to investigate the impact of space weather on Earth's energy markets and price volatility. 

## Data Sources
- Uk electricity spot prices: [Elexon API / National Grid ESO / Nord Pool]
- Solar wind and geomagnetic indicies [NASA OMNIWeb / NOAA / SWPC]

## Goals
- Explore potential short-term and lagged correlations
- Assess implications for energy market risk models and infrastructure resilience

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, COMPLETE WHEN PROJECT DONE EIDJFASOFJHEAOIFJIOAJFIAEJFPAJEFP)
